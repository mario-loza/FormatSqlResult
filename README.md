# FormatSqlResult
This small tool helps developers to store ssms queries results in a string format so they can be copied for latter reference. This has come in handy for me when trying to resolve issues, I can get a history of the queries along with my notes.

# How to use
After runnig a query on ssms just copy all the results usign the 'include headers' option and see the magic. the open the application and click on the paste button.

Then select the format options, clikc on format Data and then on copy all. then the text is ready for you to paste whereever you want .

# Format Options
So far, 
* There are 3 formats to create the text data. As a table, As a detail for each row, or if just copying a column of values you can format it as a  IN clause.
* We can have the data as a sql comment so it will add the  '--'
* We can also add a line number
